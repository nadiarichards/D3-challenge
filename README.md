# D3-challenge
Data visualization challenge using JavaScript's D3 library.

This D3 scatterplot is exploring a possible correlation between the poverty rate of a specific state and the percentage of population that is lacking healthcare coverage. The findings do not give grounds to make any definitive conclusions and just open the door to further research. Among the topics that would be worthwhile to explore further would be checking if there is a correlation between population subset lacking healthcare and median income as well as an amount of undocumented immigrants in that area. Would make sense to look at that data at a more granular level - either by county or zip code.

The interactive scatterplot made using JavaScript (D3 library) by utilizing data from .csv file from 2014 [US Census data.](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)
